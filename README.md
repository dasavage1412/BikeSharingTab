Shows the popularity by time by gender by weekday. I found that rotating the pages creates a better visual. See the story on Tableau public for all three images

Breakdown of total rides by gender

#Results

There are a couple key take aways from this analysis. Firstly, 75% of the people who ride these bikes are male. Secound, the most popular times to ride are Thurday through Sunday. Lastly, most rides last about 20 - 40 minutes.

I would add a gender by age and ride duration visualization to better show how long people of different ages and genders ride for. I would also map rider activiy based on the bike lanes/trails in the city to see where people usually start from. Might be a good location to do some advertising.
